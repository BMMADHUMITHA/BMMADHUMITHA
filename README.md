### About Me

Iâ€™m **B M Madhumitha**, a driven VLSI enthusiast with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (VLSI specialization) and a Minor in Computer Science from PES University, Bengaluru. My work and research focus on pushing the boundaries of digital design, hardware acceleration, and semiconductor verification.

### Academic & Research Experience
- Research Intern at **SINESys Lab, Indian Institute of Science (IISc)**, low-power hardware accelerators for solving PDEs leveraging **Sky130A**, **OpenLane**, and **Accelergy**.
- Hands-on expertise in full **RTL-to-GDSII flow (Yosys, Openlane, Icarus Verilog, OpenRoad)**, **UVM-based functional and formal verification**, **RTL Simulation**, and **FPGA prototyping**.
- Selected as part of the prestigious **NXP Women in Tech program (Top 50 nationwide)**, trained in advanced semiconductor design methodologies.

### Interests
- **ASIC & SoC Design:** RTL coding, timing optimization, layout-aware design.
- **Functional Verification:** Developing reusable UVM testbenches, DFT, and robust validation techniques.
- **Computer Architecture:** Modeling and simulation of RISC-V and x86 pipelines.
- **Analog & Mixed Signal Design:** Designing SAR ADCs, PRBS Generators, and dynamic analog circuits in Cadence Virtuoso.
- **Open Source EDA Tools:** Skilled with OpenLane, Yosys, KLayout, Magic, and others for physical design automation.

### Research Interests
Innovating **memory and computation architectures** for efficient, resource-optimized integration. Advancing **secure, real-time systems** to enable reliable hardware solutions in dynamic environments.
